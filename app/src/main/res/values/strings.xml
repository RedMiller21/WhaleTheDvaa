    <string name="AboutTheWhale">White Hat Application for Learning and Evaluation, or WHALE, is a tool to help you
        learn about how common Android app vulnerabilities can be exploited and mitigated. This app aims to help you
        understand how you can develop secure Android applications by avoiding common design flaws or protecting against
        common attacks, as well as improve your skills as a penetration tester conducting an evaluation of an app’s
        security.

    <string name="flags">The progress page is where you can enter the flags you have found from the vulnerabilities. You
        can find this page through the main vulnerability selector, or the difficulty selector for each vulnerability.
        Press ‘Enter Flag’ to add the flag you have found. You can view your progress in the progress bars which display
        how many of the vulnerabilities you have completed overall, as well as broken down by difficulty level.
    </string>
    <string name="l33tSpeak">When you have successfully exploited a vulnerability, you will find a flag – a piece of
        text in leet speak, or “L33T SP34K”, such as 4PPL3S or B4N4N4S. Once you have this flag, enter it in the
        progress page to update your progress.
    </string>
    <string name="mitigation">On the difficulty selector page, you can view how your chosen vulnerability is caused and
        commonly mitigated. This explains which flaws allow an attacker to exploit the application, and how they can be
        fixed to prevent these kind of attacks.
    </string>
    <string name="vulnerabilties">When you select ‘Get Splashing’, you will be directed to the vulnerability selection
        page. Here you will see the range of common Android vulnerabilities WHALE offers for you to try and exploit,
        each with varying levels of difficulty – easy, medium, and ‘killer’.
    </string>
    <string name="hints">Each vulnerability comes with three hints that can be viewed by selecting the ‘Hints’ button in
        the top right. The three hints will progressively give away more clues as to how you can exploit the
        vulnerability and get the flag.
    </string>
    <string name="information">At the top right of each page is the information button which gives information about the
        vulnerability. This will give you your scenario as a hacker trying to exploit the app, including any of the
        details about your victim you may need, such as their email address. This will appear when you open the
        vulnerability, as well as any time you click this button.
    </string>
    <string name="progress">The progress page is where you can enter the flags you have found from the vulnerabilities.
        You can find this page through the main vulnerability selector, or the difficulty selector for each

        the 4th of march 2019 can be:

        the contact can be left empty
    </string>
    <string name="tfamitigations">These tokens should be completely randomised and should not follow any distinguishable
        pattern. The use of a time-based randomisation methods or algorithms to calculate the next code makes it easy to
        predict what the next code will be, using the current time. Instead, a randomisation function should be used to
        create a unique token not based on any pattern or other value as to avoid repetition or the chances of this
        token falling into the wrong hands and being used by an attacker to access a user\'s account.
    </string>
    <string name="pamitigations">Due to the fact that the authentication of pins and passwords can only be as strong as
        the user\'s pin or password this can be problematic if the user stores their pins in obvious places or use
        words/phrases that are easily identifyable to the user. This can be prevented by using pins that do not relate
        to the user in any way. Increasing pins also helps as there can be far more combinationsfor possible pins that
        an attacker will have to try.
    </string>
    <string name="paeinstructions">However safe a log-in system can be made, if a user does not hide their pins or
        creates their
        pins from easily identifiable information, the system can be easily bypassed.

        To gain the flag use the user\'s social media account to figure out their pin
    </string>
    <string name="paminstructions">Due to the number of passwords and pins people have to remember, ways of noting down
        pins are
        often done such as including a contact in their phone to remind them of their pin. Using the user phone book on

        SQL Injection is a form of code injection, usually used by an attacker to target data driven applications. Users

    <string name="SQLiMitigations">
        SQL Injection can be prevented by using prepared statements. Prepared statements pass the query and the data to
        the database separately preventing malicious user entries to be executed.
        A developer may also wish to prevent SQL by thoroughly validating input, preventing users from entering common
        phrases used during the attacks such as SELECT. Although it is recommended this should be used alongside
        prepared statements.

        Two Factor Authentication is used to provide another way of verifying a user\'s identity, using something they have such as a code or device as well as something they know, such as their password.
        If 2FA codes are generated in a way that is predictable or can be intercepted, hackers can use them to access a user\'s information. This can be protected by avoiding distributing codes through SMS or email,
        and using devices such as Universal Second Factor devices such as USB keys.

        SQL injection is a form of code injection in which the user can manipulate a program to output otherwise protected data.
        This can be protected against by using appropriate data sanitisation and also ensuring by all means that data queries are handled seperately from data input.

        You\'ve been supplied with the code for an android application which connects to a database for use internally.
        To find the flag you must look through the code and follow it\'s operations to find any security flaws.
    </string>
    <string name="HardCoding_Desc_2">
        For this exercise, you\'ve been granted access to a small section of code from a malicious android application. To find the flag here, take a look at how the code interacts with the android operating system to further itself.
    </string>
    <string name="HardCoding_Desc_3">
        This final exercise will test knowledge worked on in the previous difficulties, you\'ve been given another code segment from a malicious android application. Complete it by looking at what the code is doing to gather information on the user.

        The android method for connecting and using a database uses hardcoded variables to interact with. These variables may contain sensitive information.

        Android malware will sometimes focus on elevating it\'s privilege so that it can access more functions within the android platform. Look at how the malware does this.

    <string name="HardCoding_Hint_Medium_2">
        Usually malware will use Command and Control (or C+C) servers to connect \'back home\'. Finding out how the malicious code actually achieves this will allow security analysts to investigate the attacker further, and help you find the flag!

        Just like the previous activity, this malware connects to a C+C server, albeit in a different manner, the information used to connect back could help find the flag.

        In this example, you\'ve still been given a log file. However more measures have been put in place in the apps the user has interacted with to avoid data leakage.
